Comencem carregant les dades del csv 

```{r}
zacatrus_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Jose\\Dropbox\\UOC\\20202021-02\\TCVD\\Pr2\\games_wih_rating.csv", sep=';', header=TRUE)

zacatrus_data
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
